This is my first portfolio site. I made this as a submision for my L100 project work.
The code may be a little bit unorganized. This was done to cut some few lines of code in my initial submission of the work.
But I'm working on a much organized structure [Here](https://github.com/Kuameh/ashiangmor/tree/SCSS-Architecture) with scss.
